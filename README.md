"Looking For" Eye Morph Landing Page
------------------------------------
This is an http port 80 landing page I did for my personal website as a gateway to filter crawlers and non-technical
casual visitors that don't know how to specify a port number for a URL (in this case, the real site is on port 800).

It's mainly just JavaScript that animates the landing page message as a kind of irony. It displays the message "The
page you're looking for is on port 800", and then cleverly morphs it into an eye looking back at you.

This was the result of a few beers and a laptop one weekend :)
