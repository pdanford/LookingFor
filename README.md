"Looking For" Eye Morph Landing Page Filter
-------------------------------------------
This is a landing page I did for my personal website as a kind of filter. It acts as a gateway by displaying a message to specify port number 800 in the URL to proceed to the main website.

It uses JavaScript to animate the landing page message as a kind of wordplay by displaying the message "The
page you're looking for is on port 800" and then morphs the message into an eye looking for you.
